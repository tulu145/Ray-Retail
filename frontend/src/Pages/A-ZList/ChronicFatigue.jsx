When one suffers from a mild fatigue syndrome, he/she might experience reduced mobility, disturbed sleeping patterns and the urge to take naps during afternoon. When fatigue turns severe, it becomes difficult for one to perform minimal daily tasks such as combing their hair, brushing teeth, changing clothes, bending down to tie shoe lace etc.

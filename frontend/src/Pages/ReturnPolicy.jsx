During summer, some of Ray’s Healthy Living products are particularly susceptible to the effects of heat (such as health bars, which can melt). Should there be a possibility that you will not be available to receive the package from the carrier, please provide specific instructions to leave the delivery to a sufficiently cool area, an alternate nearby address, or not to deliver should no one be available for receipt on your behalf.
                            </p>

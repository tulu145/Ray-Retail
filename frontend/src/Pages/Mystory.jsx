                            MY STORY
                        </h1>

                        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

                            <p>Now, you might be thinking “but I’ve heard all this before, Ray”.</p>
                            <p>Let me tell you a little story about your pal, Ray, and why you’re guaranteed only the best product and support from Ray’s Healthy Living:</p>
                            <p>My folks and family was brought up in grassroots living. Live by your word, work for your dreams, never betray a trust… these were the virtues we lived by. However, we weren’t really concerned with our health and lifestyle. That is, until we lost my dad and my grandmother far too early in life. And the main culprit wasn’t simply the illnesses they had: it was their nutrition and lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>That’s when my mom started her crusade of healthy living. She researched and studied about the essentials of having a beautiful, healthy lifestyle. And she didn’t want to stop with herself and our family. She wanted everyone to enjoy the same benefits.</p>
                            <p>She started to invite people to our home, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, or complete strangers who were interested in a lifestyle that promoted health and wellness. Pretty soon, she was out meeting people in flea markets, farmer’s markets, and such sharing what she knew while building a growing business. Nature SunShine was the first brand mom adopted, as it was the first company to largely promote herbal supplements in capsules. Pretty soon, other family members joined her and now serve communities all around with their own health and wellness stores that both sell natural products and also provide nutritional advice and support.</p>
                            <p>So where does your pal Ray come in?</p>
                            <p>I was a careless youth with a reckless lifestyle back in the day. While my mom was doing her thing with health and wellness, I was going out to make my own stamp in life. Eventually, I started working at a Laundromat. I liked it so much I went into the Laundromat business for 10 years. So, why did I change my line of business and followed my mom’s footsteps?</p>
                            <p>At age 45, I started feeling the consequences of my unhealthy lifestyle as a younger man. I was 45 lbs. overweight and even though I go to the gym, I wasn’t maximizing my health and wellness. I struggled for about 20 years with a sharp pain on my lower hips. I met and got tested by doctors and hospitals, but none of them could figure out what was wrong until I met with a urologist who suggested I change my diet to a more natural one. That’s when I had the revelation that mom was right all along!</p>
                            <p>From then on, I realized mom had been helping a lot of people since the 1980s to live a beautiful and healthy lifestyle. I decided I would do the same, taking up the same goals and motivation mom lived by: offer the highest quality of natural products and help customers live their lives to the fullest. You could say the rest is history from there!</p>
                            <p>But wait, there’s more!</p>
                            <p>I realized mom’s traditional approach might not be the best in this day and age. After carefully studying our options, mom and I decided to take our vision and goals online to reach out to more people who share the same desire: live healthy and beautiful lives with the help of natural products. And so, Ray’s Healthy Living is born and always willing to serve you!</p>

                            <p>Ray’s Healthy Living uses optimal percentage for its use of alcohol in acquiring extracts from the natural ingredients in its products. We use a range of 35% to 90%, depending on what is the best for getting quality extracts. For instance, extracts from mushrooms require a 35% alcohol percentage while we use something closer to 90% for resinous plants like myrrh gum. We ensure this fact is noted in each product Ray’s Healthy Living ships out.</p>

                            <p>Our products are mostly in liquid form. Ray’s Healthy Living has found this choice has benefits over the traditional oral consumption in the form of pills. Let’s look at the most important benefits:</p>
                            <p>BIOAVAILABILITY – You can’t gain benefits from herbs if they aren’t digested properly. Our products in liquid form are more absorbable than they would be as pills. Extracts retain their natural taste which also improves the absorption through digestive enzymes. As they are in liquid form, these products are also more manageable to consume for most customers.</p>
                            <p>EASE OF USE – Some individuals, particularly the elderly and young children, find some difficulty in oral consumption of pills. In liquid form, most people can drink them readily or even mix them in water or juices.</p>
                            <p>POTENCY – When broken down into pills, the herbs lose some of their effectiveness. Liquid herbal products retain greater potency, according to professional herbalists, naturopaths, and other alternative medicine experts.</p>
                            <p>FAST EFFECTS – Thanks to being easier to absorb and being more potent, liquid herbal products produce the intended effects at a faster rate than if they were in the form of pills. This is particularly important for those who are looking relief from conditions like pain management and sleep disorders.</p>
                            <p>These are just some of the key benefits from tinctures and other liquid herbal products in Ray’s Healthy Living product line.</p>

                            {/* <p>EASE OF USE – Some individuals, particularly the elderly and young children, find some difficulty in oral consumption of pills. In liquid form, most people can drink them readily or even mix them in water or juices.</p>
                            <p>POTENCY – When broken down into pills, the herbs lose some of their effectiveness. Liquid herbal products retain greater potency, according to professional herbalists, naturopaths, and other alternative medicine experts.</p>
                            <p>FAST EFFECTS – Thanks to being easier to absorb and being more potent, liquid herbal products produce the intended effects at a faster rate than if they were in the form of pills. This is particularly important for those who are looking relief from conditions like pain management and sleep disorders.</p>
                            <p>These are just some of the key benefits from tinctures and other liquid herbal products in Ray’s Healthy Living product line.</p> */}
